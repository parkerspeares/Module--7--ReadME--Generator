Professional README Generator
Description
This project provides an interactive command-line tool for creating professional README files for development projects. It generates a structured README template by prompting the user with questions in the Command Line Interface (CLI), streamlining the process of formatting inputs into markdown. Through this project, I gained practical experience with README structure, Node.js, the Inquirer package, module imports, error handling, and writing output to files.
